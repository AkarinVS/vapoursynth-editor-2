THIS MANUAL IS A DRAFT. PLEASE REPORT ANY MISTAKES OR ADDITIONS AT https://bitbucket.org/mystery_keeper/vapoursynth-editor

Building VapourSynth Editor from source:

1) make sure you meet the prerequisites explained below;
2) open the system terminal and change working directory to the "pro" directory in the source tree;
3) execute command "qmake" to generate the Makefile and other intermediate files;
4) "make" the Makefile with the specific make-tool:
"make" if you are on Linux or using MSys on Windows;
"mingw32-make" for MinGW;
"nmake" for MS Visual Studio;
program files will be built in compiler specific sub-directory in the "build" directory in source tree and ready to use.

Prerequisites

You need C++11 (or higher) compiler and Qt5 development distribution corresponding to the compiler.
Make sure the executable directories of both tools are included in PATH system environment variable.
Qt5 distribution version should be no less than 5.6.1 for some features to work.
Failing to meet this requirement will cause CLI tools video encoding crash on MS Windows due to I/O bug in Qt.

Windows:

- get compiler of your choice (MinGW and MSVC are fully supported);
- get Qt5 distribution corresponding to your compiler (https://www.qt.io/download/).

Linux:

- install following packages: build-essential, qtbase5-dev;
- if your Linux distribution has Qt4 development packages installed - you might want to install package qt5-default.

MacOS:
